# MYE-Renewable-Energy-App
Welcome to the Mind Your Energy (MYE) project repository! Our team consists of six passionate individuals who share a common interest in renewable energy and technology. We are excited to be participating in a startup challenge organized by the three major universities in Milan: Bocconi, Statale, and Politecnico. Notably, our team members come from all of these prestigious institutions, including Bicocca University. Together, we are committed to making a positive impact in the field of renewable energy through innovative solutions and collaborative efforts.

Our goal is to develop a software application and smartphone platform that helps individuals and communities monitor and optimize their renewable energy consumption. With this project, we hope to promote sustainability, reduce energy waste, and provide easy-to-use tools for users to track their progress towards energy efficiency.

This repository will contain the codebase for the MYE software application and other relevant resources. We hope that our work will contribute to the growing movement towards renewable energy and inspire others to take action towards a more sustainable future.

I was assigned various tasks that encompassed the following areas:
1. User Interface and User Experience Design Prototype for the Smartphone Application.
2. Drafting a Machine Learning algorithm to analyze energy consumption and production.
3. Estimating the costs associated with the development and deployment of the software.
These tasks were an integral part of my responsibilities.
