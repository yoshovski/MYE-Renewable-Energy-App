# MYE-Renewable-Energy-App
Welcome to the Mind Your Energy (MYE) project repository! Our team is composed of 6 individuals who are passionate about renewable energy and technology. We are participating in a startup challenge that involves the 3 major universities in Milan: Bocconi, Statale, and Politecnico.

Our goal is to develop a software application and smartphone platform that helps individuals and communities monitor and optimize their renewable energy consumption. With this project, we hope to promote sustainability, reduce energy waste, and provide easy-to-use tools for users to track their progress towards energy efficiency.

This repository will contain the codebase for the MYE software application and other relevant resources. We hope that our work will contribute to the growing movement towards renewable energy and inspire others to take action towards a more sustainable future.
